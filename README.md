# Folder-based Authorization for Jenkins

[![Build Status](https://ci.jenkins.io/job/Plugins/job/folder-auth-plugin/job/master/badge/icon)](https://ci.jenkins.io/job/Plugins/job/folder-auth-plugin/job/master/)

This plugin adds an authorization strategy for Jenkins that works on Cloudbees' Folder plugin. Permissions given to a user
for a folder are inherited by all its children.
